Arkham Horror LCG module for OCTGN improvement with:

FEATURES:
·Group / Ungroup Table Cards.
·Move entire group of cards just dragging one of them.
·Moving a grouped card out of the Table (another pile, discarding, deleting, etc.) will ungroup only that card automatically.

HOW TO INSTALL:
Once Arkham Module is installed within OCTGN, unzip [AHLCG.zip](https://github.com/NMisut/arkham-horror/releases/download/1.1/AHLCG.zip) onto:

%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Programs\OCTGN\Data\GameDatabase\a6d114c7-2e2a-4896-ad8c-0330605c90bf

This will overwrite the original module script files so to revert to the original module, the following steps are required:
- Uninstall the module within OCTGN.
